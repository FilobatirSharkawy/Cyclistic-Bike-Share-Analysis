Data Processing Documentation

This document outlines the data processing steps performed on the Cyclistic trip data from May 2022 to April 2023 for the purpose of the analysis. The data processing includes adding new columns to calculate the ride length and determine the day of the week for each trip. Additionally, data cleaning was conducted to remove records with inconsistent ride length values.

Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is the Cyclistic trip data obtained from May 2022 to April 2023. The dataset consists of multiple CSV files, each representing a specific month of trip data.

Data Process

1. Column Addition: Ride Length
   - To calculate the length of each trip, a new column named "ride_length" was added.
   - The ride length was determined by subtracting the "started_at" timestamp from the "ended_at" timestamp.

2. Column Addition: Day of the Week
   - A new column named "day_of_week" was added to determine the day of the week for each trip.
   - The "day_of_week" column was generated using the `WEEKDAY()` function applied to the "started_at" column.
   - The "day_of_week" values range from 1 to 7, where 1 represents Sunday and 7 represents Saturday.

Data Cleaning

During the data cleaning process, records with inconsistent ride length values were identified and removed from each corresponding data file. The following inconsistencies were addressed:

- In the 202206 file, 12 records with negative ride_length values were deleted.
- In the 202207 file, 16 records with negative ride_length values were deleted.
- In the 202208 file, 15 records with negative ride_length values were deleted.
- In the 202209 file, 9 records with negative ride_length values were deleted.
- In the 202210 file, 4 records with negative ride_length values were deleted.
- In the 202211 file, 41 records with negative ride_length values were deleted.
- In the 202302 file, a single record with a negative ride_length value was deleted.
- In the 202304 file, 4 records with negative ride_length values were deleted.

Summary

The data processing steps outlined in this documentation involved the addition of columns to calculate ride length and determine the day of the week for each trip. Additionally, data cleaning was conducted to remove records with inconsistent ride length values. These processed and cleaned datasets serve as the basis for further analysis of the Cyclistic bike share data.
